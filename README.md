# rwMod_config
.INI config file for Rusted Warfare 

This is the whole code for one unit... 
[ðŸ§“ðŸ”«ðŸŽ¯] Kardel Sharpeye, The Dwarven Sniper 
For Rusted Warfare... it took me days to complete this piece.. implementing
the [Q]Shrapnel ability of Sniper to the unit makes it a bit complicated that
it takrs me 3 whole days to implement it... and in order to mimic the 
[Q]Shrapnel ability effect of Sniper to Rusted Warfare, I utilized 2 projectiles, 
1 for the ballistic effect, a surface to air missile then 2 for the "actual" "raining"
effects...

the code works but it is proven to be a lousy version of sniper.. This will get reworked soon..

Soon.. when i figured out how to implement the Skillpoint System and School doesn't kill me..
