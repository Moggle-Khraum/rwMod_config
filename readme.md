Credits: Paul for the "Piercing Projectile" projectile assets.

*Bugs: Theres a bug that when two "Snipers" met and attacked each other, they'll get somehow "teleported" to the other side of the map 'RANDOMLY'.. and Also once you get closer to the Shrapnel Crater, you'll get stuck for eternity, unless a "bug" again happens.. which you'll get "teleported" again to the other side of the Map.
